            Ground Control to Major Tom. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on. Ground Control to
            Major Tom (ten, nine, eight, seven, six). Commencing countdown,
            engines on (five, four, three). Check ignition and may God's love be
            with you (two, one, liftoff). This is Ground Control to Major Tom.

            You've really made the grade. And the papers want to know whose shirts
            you wear. Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare. This is
            Major Tom to Ground Control. I'm stepping through the door.
